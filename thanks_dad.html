<h1>A Week With Sylvia and Anita</h1>

<h3>Saturday</h3>
They arrive at our place around noon. Its raining, so we just hang out for a bit. Then, braving the drizzle, we head out for a walk along Ponsonby. We stop back at our place briefly, and walk to the viaduct. We were thinking dinner at <i>Good George</i>, but nothing on the menu strikes our fancy. We have some drinks and chips (and crisps), then head to the <i>Birdcage</i> for dinner.

<h3>Sunday</h3>
Sunday we take the ferry to Waiheke Island, an island in Auckland harbour with wineries and views.

We take in the scene for a bit and move on, loosing Sylvia for a bit and eating some empenadas. We visit a honey farm, several wineries, and see some views.</p>

Dinner that night was <i>Vino Vino</i> on the island, complete with a double rainbow over the bay. I had "Scallops from Hell", or a similar name. It was supposed to be devilishly hot scallops, but Kiwis don't really do spice, so it was pretty mild, but tasty.

We walk home through the park, and do some star gazing. Nikki and I almost step on it in the dark, but Sylvia spots the hedgehog.</p><br>

<h3>Monday</h3>

Monday we walked around the city, in imitation of how I spend my days. We took a bus to Mount Eden, and found a bakery for some pies. Then we climbed to the top of the (extinct) volcano. There were some lovely views of the crater, and of the city.

We walked to Newmarket for some shopping, then a short bus to Parnell for more shops, including the honey store for Anita. A short walk (though a steep hill) got us to the Parnell rose garden.

Finally, we took an Uber to the Viaduct for dinner. It was Nikki's Birthday, so she got to pick, and we ended up at <i>Portofino</i>, an Italian place overlooking the harbor. I had spaghetti carbonara. It was good, but not as good as Mom used to make. After dinner we found a tiny gelato place with some very good chocolate mint gelato.

<h3>Tuesday</h3>

		<td align='top'>Tuesday the girls went to Rangitoto by themselves. Rangitoto is an island that is 600 years old, erupting about the same time as the Maori came to New Zealand. There is a lot of vegitation, but the volcanic rocks are very much in evidence.<br><br>Nikki spent the day at work, and I recuperated a bit from the doubling of our household. We met the girls in the viaduct after their trip, and had dinner at <i>Dr Rudi's</i>, a rooftop brewery. We had three feet of pizza. Not a yard, three separate feet.
