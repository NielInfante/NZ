<h1>A Week With Sylvia and Anita</h1>

<h3>Saturday</h3>
They arrive at our place around noon. Its raining, so we just hang out for a bit. Then, braving the drizzle, we head out for a walk along Ponsonby. We stop back at our place breifly, and walk to the viaduct. We were thinking dinner at Good George, but nothing on the menu strikes our fancy. We have some drinks and chips, then head to the Birdcage for dinner.
