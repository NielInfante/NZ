<h2>Day 1</h2>
We have to get up a little early, but the flight to Christchurch is easy. We pick up our car and we're off on our adventure! We're driving to Hokitika via Arthur's pass. First stop, Sheffield Pies. Good Moroccan beef pie, Nikki had peach passionfruit. There were more flavors I wanted to try, but we had to move on. Next stop, a random (one lane) bridge.

The scenic beauty, the colors, the clarity of the water. These will be recurring themes.

A bit further up the road we stopped to hike to the Devil's Punchbowl.
