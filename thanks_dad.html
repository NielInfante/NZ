<h1>A Week With Sylvia and Anita</h1>

<h3>Saturday</h3>
They arrive at our place around noon. Its raining, so we just hang out for a bit. Then, braving the drizzle, we head out for a walk along Ponsonby. We stop back at our place briefly, and walk to the viaduct. We were thinking dinner at Good George, but nothing on the menu strikes our fancy. We have some drinks and chips, then head to the Birdcage for dinner.

<h3>Sunday</h3>
Sunday we take the ferry to Waiheke Island, an island in Auckland harbour with wineries and views.

We take in the scene for a bit and move on, loosing Sylvia for a bit and eating some empenadas. We visit a honey farm, several wineries, and see some views.</p>

Dinner that night was Vino Vino on the island, complete with a double rainbow over the bay.

We walk home through the park, and do some star gazing. Nikki and I almost step on it in the dark, but Sylvia spots the hedgehog.</p>
